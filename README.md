# Healthcare Disparities

* Healthcare Disparities tackles the question: Is there a correlation between demographics of race and rural/urban, and specific treatable healthcare conditions in hospitals across the United States? Data is collected from U.S. Census Bureau 2019 (include link), and CMS data from hospitals across the country (include link).
